# Locker-2.0
Locker 2.0 was my **first official batch application**. You can use this **Batch Application** to lock a folder using a **notepad script** or **cmd** trick.

# FOLDER LOCK NOTEPAD CODE – LOCKER 2.0 (MY FIRST BATCH APPLICATION)
I started this journey by the concept of “How to Hiding My Personal Data in my Computer?”. So, No-one can have access to that data except me. And, I must say – that I have learned a lot from this simple project.

When I searched about this type of program on the internet, I Got one Built on batch Platform, it was a pre-built application (or Program may be a better term). I downloaded it and used it, But it was not that effective program because of a simple security flaw of the program.

# PROBLEM WITH LOCKER 1.0
As anyone with a little knowledge of Batch programming, can edit that batch program and he/she can see the one important line. (As Follows)
```
IF "%Password%" == "MyPasswordWrittenHere"
```
Then He/She can easily access my **Personal data**. So, I decided to modify it a bit. So, I created **Locker 2.0** and there may be lots of unnecessary lines of code. It may contain Some **Bugs** as well, but you should know that it was built when I didn’t know anything about **batch programming**.
